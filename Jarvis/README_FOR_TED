DELETE THIS FILE AFTER PROJECT IS DONE LOLOLOL

Dear my good friend Ted,

After re-reading the instructions for the project, it appears we can
put both the main Jarvis code logic and database code in the same file
(jarvis.py). We will discuss how this will work in the next meeting. For
now, I just wanted to give you an idea of how sqlit3 works in general and
how it will look when you create the database. In the jarvis.py file, you
will add some code logic blah blah blah for setting up the database and 
when you run it, it will create a database file called jarvis.db in this
same directory (Jarvis/Jarvis). Then, you will write some more code logic
that will add/remove items to/from the database, read items that are in 
the database, etc. We can then connect this code logic to our code so 
that it executes when someone types something in the Slack workspace.
Most/all of your code will be in functions so they are easy to call. We
will discuss/scheme the exact layout during the meeting. I promise you,
sqlit3 isn't as hardcore and scary as it appears, especially if you have
previous experience working with mySQL. It is literally just a Python 
interface to the database management system SQLite (which is very similar)
to mySQL. For example, instead of going pr0 h4xx0r mode in your terminal
or whatever and typing out commands, you would write something like:
    
    CONNECTED_DATABASE_OBJECT_NAME.execute('''CREATE TABLE blah blah blah''') or
    CONNECTED_DATABASE_OBJECT_NAME.execute("INSERT INTO blah blah blah")

in the code and it would execute when you ran the script. Hopefully that
clarifies things a little. Once again, we will talk about it more next
meeting. Don't worry about doing anything right now, just look up the 
basic commands for sqlit3!
