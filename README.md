# Jarvis
The most epic chatbot for Slack ever written (actually just a project for CS 287 Data Science I).

## Note 
This project was implemented for CS 287 Data Science I. It was built as a research project for educational purposes and is not intended to be
run as commercial software. However, we have released it under the permissive MIT License and anyone is welcome to use any and all code in this
repository within their own projects. In order for the Jarvis chatbot to run, certain setup procedures are required for the Slack App configuration.
To inquire about these setup procedures, feel free to open an issue and we will get back to you as soon as possible!
